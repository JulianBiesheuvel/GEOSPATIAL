# GEOSPATIAL Assignment

Hello and welcome to our GitHub repository with our assignment for the course Data Science & Artificial Intelligence for Engineers (CEGM2003), as part of the Master Applied Earth Science and Civil Engineering at the Delft University of Technology. In short, the project aims to compare deterministic versus probabilistic interpolation. We will use Kriging as a deterministic approach and for the probabilistic approach Gaussian Processes. In the end, we want to qualitatively compare the two methods. For more information on the scope of the project and further details, please see the [full project description](https://surfdrive.surf.nl/files/index.php/s/HVIy8Y2Yg6mLorB/download?path=%2F&files=GEOSPATIAL__Exploring%20the%20effect%20of%20different%20formulations%20of%20Gaussian%20processes%20on%20spatial%20predictions.pdf).
